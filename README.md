# Facial-Recognition-System

att_faces.zip   ------->    AT&T database of 400 faces: 40 subjects, 10 photos each 

This project implements a software implementation of facial identifcation in MATLAB using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) function with a k-nearest neightbor (kNN) classifier.

The database used for the experiment is the AT&T Laboratories face database (also known as the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) face database). There are 400 images total, 10 of each subject. Each image of a subject is slightly different in some way, with variations in time of day, lighting, facial expressions, and facial details (i.e. glasses). All images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position. The size of each PGM image is 112 x 92 pixels, with 256 grey levels per pixel.
